# studydiscordbot

My friend spent too much time playing video games instead of studying. In order to help him out, we decided we should make an accountability bot to help make him stay focused when he was not supposed to be studying. I made a discord bot that was authorized on our server. When his game status would change, it would send a message to the group reminding him to study. It would also change its status name. This way we all know he was playing. 

The next step for this bot is to set it up for timing so it would only alert us when he played during the typical work hours 7am-5pm or late at night.
